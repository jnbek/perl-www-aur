NAME
    WWW::AUR - API for the Archlinux User Repository website.

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::AUR;
      my $aur = WWW::AUR->new( basepath => '/tmp/aurtmp' );
      my $pkg = $aur->find( 'perl-www-aur' );
  
      # download_size() can check the file size without downloading...
      printf "Preparing to download source package file (%d bytes).\n",
          $pkg->download_size;
  
      $pkg->download;
      printf "Downloaded pkgfile to %s.\n", $pkg->src_pkg_path;
  
      $pkg->extract;  # calls download() if you didn't
      printf "Extracted pkgfile to %s.\n", $pkg->src_dir_path;
  
      $pkg->build;    # calls extract()  if you didn't
      printf "Built binary pkgfile and saved to %s.\n", $pkg->bin_pkg_path;
  
      my $who = $pkg->maintainer();
      printf "%s is maintained by %s.\n", $pkg->name, $who->name;
  
      print "As well as the following packages:\n";
      for my $otherpkg ( $who->packages ) {
          printf " - %s\n", $otherpkg->name;
      }
  
      my $login = $aur->login( 'myname', 'mypassword' )
          or die "Failed to login as myname, what a shock";
  
      $login->vote( 'my-favorite-package' );
      $login->disown( 'i-hate-this-package' );
      $login->upload( '../a-new-package-file.src.pkg.tar.gz',
                      'lib' );
  
      print "Iterating through ALL packages...\n";
      my $iter = $aur->packages;
      while ( my $pkgobj = $iter->next ) {
          my %info = $pkgobj->info;
          print "$info{name} -- $info{version}\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    The Archlinux User Repository is a relatively simple website that houses
    user-submitted packages for ArchLinux. These "source packages" merely
    contain what is required to build the package, unlike Archlinux's
    official repository which house binary packages.

    This module provides an interface for the straight-forward AUR user as
    well as for AUR author, aka package maintainers. The goal is to be able
    to do anything with this module that you could with a web browser.

    The WWW::AUR::Package module also allows the module user to download and
    build source packages using *makepkg*. Installation is left up to the
    module user and is not implemented in this module.

TESTS WARNING
    The automated testing (by using 'make test') can only succeed if there
    is an internet connection available. I suppose the tests would also fail
    if the AUR website is down...
