WWW::AUR - API for the Archlinux User Repository website.

* Background

The Archlinux User Repository is a relatively simple website that houses
user-submitted packages for ArchLinux. These "source packages" merely
contain what is required to build the package, unlike Archlinux's
official repository which house binary packages.

* Requirements

The following modules are required for the use of WWW::AUR and
friends. I provide this information in case you are wondering about
lots of dependencies or maybe you aren't lucky enough to use a CPAN
shell.

Instead of listing each module used, I list each distribution (aka
package) that you need to install from CPAN. This makes more sense
to me and is more succinct.

- libwww-perl
- URI
- JSON

Logins to the AUR connect using the https port and are encrypted
to protect your password and session cookie. In order to use
WWW::AUR::Login you will also need the LWP-Protocol-https
distribution installed. This brings in its own set of requirements
for using SSL connections.

** Core Modules

These distributions are included with perl (as of version 5.10) so
you probably won't need to download them:

- Archive-Tar
- Carp
- Fctnl
- File-Path (2.06)
- PathTools (for File::Spec and Cwd)

* Install

To install this module follow these steps. If you have already downloaded
and extracted the distribution tarball (WWW-AUR-<version>.tar.gz) in order
to read this README file skip to step 4.

1) Download the distribution tarball from CPAN.
2) Extract the tarball.
3) *cd* into the extracted directory (WWW-AUR-<version>)
4) Run *perl Makefile.PL* to create a *Makefile*
5) Run *make* to build the module using the *Makefile*
6) (Optional) Run *make test* to run automated self-tests.
7) Run *make install* to install the perl module into a system directory.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

curl -O http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/J/JU/JUSTER/WWW-AUR-X.XX.tar.gz
tar xf WWW-AUR-X.XX.tar.gz
cd WWW-AUR-X.XX
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
sudo make install

#+END_EXAMPLE

Or better yet use a CPAN shell to do it for you! Cpanminus is available
on CPAN under the name "App-cpanminus".

* Purpose

WWW::AUR has two basic purposes:

1) Interacting with the AUR webpage (http://aur.archlinux.org)
2) Building source packages by calling the makepkg script.
   (http://www.archlinux.org/pacman/makepkg.8.html)

** Web Page

This module provides an interface for the straight-forward AUR user as
well as for package author and trusted user. The (unmet) goal is to be able
to do anything with this module that you could with a web browser.

** Package Building

The WWW::AUR::Package module also allows the module user to download and
build source packages using makepkg. Installation is left up to the
module user and is not implemented in this module.

* Testing

The automated testing (by using 'make test') can only succeed if there
is an internet connection available. I suppose the tests would also fail
if the AUR website is down...
