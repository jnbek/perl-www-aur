=head1 NAME

WWW::AUR::UserAgent - Default HTTP UserAgent object for requests.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the default user agent for making HTTP requests. By default
this class ISA LWP::UserAgent object with all methods provided
by LWP::UserAgent. Maybe in the future I will fancy it up a bit more
in order to use AnyEvent and concurrent requests if I need to.

The only difference from LWP::UserAgent is that the 'useragent'
string parameter is set to "WWW::AUR/v$VERSION" where $VERSION
is equal to $WWW::AUR::VERSION.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

Right now the methods are the same as LWP::UserAgent.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

This class also contains the C<InitTLS> class method to load
the modules required for SSL/TLS https connections. This is only
used by the WWW::AUR::Login module. C<InitTLS> takes no parameters.
I find this an improvement compared to having C<LWP::UserAgent>
raise an error internally.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<WWW::AUR>
