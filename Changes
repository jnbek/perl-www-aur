* Release 0.17 [2012-12-11 Mon]

** Fix WWW::AUR::Login to use the new login and submit URLs.

The old AUR allowed logins from any webpage. The new AUR only allows
logins from the /login/ page. Package submition now takes place at
the /submit/ URL.

** Fix compilation error for perl 5.17.

Perl version 5.17 does not like unescaped open curly brackets in
regexps. CPAN testers kept sending me fail reports.

** More JSON RPC updates.

I missed some obsolete code.

** Switch the default url scheme to https.

Because JSON now only works with https we require the https support.
Almost everything requires JSON so we might as well use https for
everything else, too.

** Fix a typo in WWW::AUR::RPC.

msearch had a call to status_code instead of status_line for an
HTTP::Response object.

* Release 0.16 [2012-11-09 Fri]  

** Update WWW::AUR::RPC for RPC JSON changes.

The JSON changed in several ways. An error is no longer emitted when
there are no results. Result counts were added to the results (but not
used).  Creation time and modification time were added. We can also
use the maintainer name from the JSON results instead of needing a
seperate page scrape.

** Fix package list scraping to work for new AUR HTML design.

WWW::AUR::Iterator was broken because the HTML changed. This has been
updated and the id element of the iterator was removed because that
information is no longer supplied. The packages.php URL was also changed
to packages/.

** Fix missed updates for RPC changes.

Remove more error checking when no results are found, which no longer applies.
The WWW::AUR::URI::rpc_uri sub always uses https no matter which scheme is
specified by $WWW::AUR::Scheme.

* Release 0.15 [2012-06-26 Tue]                                         :FIX:

** Update WWW::AUR::Login to use the new security token for actions.

The aur.archlinux.org website was updated to require a new security token
for package actions. This prevents XSS vulnerabilities. The token is the
same as the session ID cookie.

* Release 0.14 [2012-02-22 Wed]

** Message checking for unnotify action response had a typo.            :FIX:

If you used the unnotify method of a Login object, the code that checks
the response from the website had a missing character in it. So unnotify
would always appear to fail.

* Release 0.13 [2011-11-06 Sun]

** WWW::AUR::Iterator yields proper vote count and category.            :FIX:

Previously, the vote count was mistaken for the category id. Neato!
The hash key names that WWW::AUR::Iterator::next() returns are also
changed slightly. 'maintainer' is shortened to 'maint' and 'category'
is shortened to 'cat'.

* Release 0.12 [2011-08-21 Sun]

** Update PKGBUILD and package file URLs to match AUR changes.

AUR package URLs are now stored under a new directory component.
The new url component consists of the first two characters in the
name of the package.

The old URLs still work but I thought it wise to upgrade. Also
adds a new 12-url.t test for simple URL tests.

** Adds the multiinfo method to the WWW::AUR::RPC module.

Yeah, the WWW::AUR::RPC module is undocumented and only used
internally... but what the heck! I don't seem to have a use
for it yet but maybe one day.

* Release 0.11 [2011-07-10 Sun]

** Fix tests, perl-cpanplus-dist-arch has moved to community.

We can no longer look up the perl-cpanplus-dist-arch package on the
AUR since it is not there anymore.

* Release 0.10 [2011-05-25 Wed]

** Add set_pos() method to WWW::AUR::Iterator.

This is nice if you want to start iterating where you left off
last. Keep in mind that the value you give set_pos() is not the ID of
the package it is simply the offset that is given to the packages.php
webpage as a query parameter.

** Depend array with extra whitespace now parses                        :FIX:

The only package on the AUR that seems to have this problem is
turbovnc-bin.  To give you an idea of the problem, the depend string
looks like this:

: depends=('turbojpegipp >=1.11')

This was throwing an error from inside WWW::AUR::PKGBUILD when attempting
to parse this.

*** Adds new test to parse example PKGBUILDs from the AUR

I added a new test and a new directory (t/PKGBUILDs) for testing real-
world examples that I find on the AUR. I have already accomodated for
some poorly written / difficult to parse PKGBUILDs but I forgot to
write tests to them. I'll try to add more later.

I wanted to be sure I could parse turbovnc-bin's PKGBUILD after making
fixes.

* Release 0.09 [2011-03-09 Wed]

** Default dependency data structure

I corrected the data structure that is created for a dependency which
does not specify a version and only a package name. Without a version
specified the dep should be satisfied by any version. The hash ref
that is created is similiar to this:

: { 'pkg' => q{...}, 'cmp' => q{>=}, 'ver' => 0, 'str' => q{...} }

** Improved PKGBUILD parsing

While I was using this module to iterate over the entire AUR I noticed
there were many badly written PKGBUILDs that did not parse
properly. Some bad (and not so bad) habits that are accounted for
include...

 - Fields which should be arrays but aren't.
 - Backslashes (\) after every array element.
 - Commented array elements.

** Expand empty parameters

Because of a mistake of mine empty but defined parameters were not
expanded to the empty string. Now they are.

** Public WWW::AUR::URI module

I documented the WWW::AUR::URI module and allowed it to be indexed
by CPAN. This module might be useful for advanced users.

** WWW::AUR::Iterator is more robust

WWW::AUR::Iterator was rewritten to provide more data without creating
a WWW::AUR::Package object. The Iterator->next() method was changed to
return a hash ref of all available data that I could scrape. The data
is scraped from the package list (packages.php) webpage on the AUR.

The old next() method which returns an object was renamed to
next_obj().

* Release 0.08 [2011-03-06 Sun]

** Rename packages() method to iter()

I thought packages() might be a bit misleading as to what you are
actually getting from the method (a WWW::AUR::Iterator object).

** Update PKGBUILD URL

The URLs for every PKGBUILD were changed on the website. The old
scheme was /packages/$pkgname/$pkgname/PKGBUILD. The new scheme is
/packages/$pkgname/PKGBUILD.

** Better PKGBUILD Parsing

*** Splits array fields on spaces
    
Some poorly authored PKGBUILDs have fields which should be arrays,
but instead are one element arrays with many elements separated
by spaces. We split arrays on spaces where possible (everywhere
except optdepends) and where array fields are expected.

*** Crude parameter expansion added

We expand previously defined bash parameters (aka PKGBUILD fields).
The expansion is very simple, no special modifiers are recognized.
(Only ${NAME} is expanded, not ${NAME:-default}, etc). No command
expansion, path expansion, etc is implemented.

** WWW::AUR::Package->maintainer_name() method added

This is handy when you don't want a full fledged WWW::AUR::Maintainer
object. When creating objects, often their names, etc, are looked
up on the AUR RPC. This takes more time.
  
* Release 0.07 [2011-02-04 Fri]

** Fix Broken Test                                                      :FIX:

I foolishly broke a test by changing outside circumstances. I had
renamed 'Archlinux::Messages' to 'Archlinux::Term' and so the
'perl-archlinux-messages' package on the AUR was deleted in favor of
'perl-archlinux-term'. One of our tests checks for the existance of
'perl-archlinux-messages' on the AUR, which fails.

* Release 0.06 [2011-02-04 Fri]

** POD Documentation

Fixes many errors in the documentation.

** PKGBUILD Parsing

PKGBUILD parsing is now more resilient. The parsing is still far from
perfect but strange quotations now result in the same value that bash
gives them. I have also changed how parsing works, internally. I
suspect it is more efficient than previously.

** Org-mode documentation

I've decided to switch to Emacs's org-mode for all README and
changelog files in my own projects.

** Logins

*** HTTPS Logins

All actions taken while logged in now use HTTPS in order to secure
the login's session key. This also requires the Crypt::SSLeay
module to be installed if you want to login and do stuff.

*** Multilingual Logins

Multilingual logins will now work properly. The internal webpage
requests are set to English so the module only has to check for errors
in one language.
   
** Delete Action Added

Adds the delete package action in case any Trusted User wants to
use this module to delete packages. It is kind of scary what you
can do with it but heck... I trust you!
