** POD Documentation

Fixes many errors in the documentation.

** PKGBUILD Parsing

PKGBUILD parsing is now more resilient. The parsing is still far from
perfect but strange quotations now result in the same value that bash
gives them. I have also changed how parsing works, internally. I
suspect it is more efficient than previously.

** Org-mode documentation

I've decided to switch to Emacs's org-mode for all README and
changelog files in my own projects.

** HTTPS Logins

All actions taken while logged in now use HTTPS in order to secure
the login's session key. This also requires the Crypt::SSLeay
module to be installed if you want to login and do stuff.
   
** Delete Action Added

Adds the delete package action in case any Trusted User wants to
use this module to delete packages. It is kind of scary what you
can do with it but heck... I trust you!
