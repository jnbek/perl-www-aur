* Release 0.08 [2011-03-06 Sun]

** Rename packages() method to iter()

I thought packages() might be a bit misleading as to what you are
actually getting from the method (a WWW::AUR::Iterator object).

** Update PKGBUILD URL

The URLs for every PKGBUILD were changed on the website. The old
scheme was /packages/$pkgname/$pkgname/PKGBUILD. The new scheme is
/packages/$pkgname/PKGBUILD.

** Better PKGBUILD Parsing

*** Splits array fields on spaces
    
Some poorly authored PKGBUILDs have fields which should be arrays,
but instead are one element arrays with many elements separated
by spaces. We split arrays on spaces where possible (everywhere
except optdepends) and where array fields are expected.

*** Crude parameter expansion added

We expand previously defined bash parameters (aka PKGBUILD fields).
The expansion is very simple, no special modifiers are recognized.
(Only ${NAME} is expanded, not ${NAME:-default}, etc). No command
expansion, path expansion, etc is implemented.

** WWW::AUR::Package->maintainer_name() method added

This is handy when you don't want a full fledged WWW::AUR::Maintainer
object. When creating objects, often their names, etc, are looked
up on the AUR RPC. This takes more time.
  
* Release 0.07 [2011-02-04 Fri]

** Fix Broken Test                                                      :FIX:

I foolishly broke a test by changing outside circumstances. I had
renamed 'Archlinux::Messages' to 'Archlinux::Term' and so the
'perl-archlinux-messages' package on the AUR was deleted in favor of
'perl-archlinux-term'. One of our tests checks for the existance of
'perl-archlinux-messages' on the AUR, which fails.

* Release 0.06 [2011-02-04 Fri]

** POD Documentation

Fixes many errors in the documentation.

** PKGBUILD Parsing

PKGBUILD parsing is now more resilient. The parsing is still far from
perfect but strange quotations now result in the same value that bash
gives them. I have also changed how parsing works, internally. I
suspect it is more efficient than previously.

** Org-mode documentation

I've decided to switch to Emacs's org-mode for all README and
changelog files in my own projects.

** Logins

*** HTTPS Logins

All actions taken while logged in now use HTTPS in order to secure
the login's session key. This also requires the Crypt::SSLeay
module to be installed if you want to login and do stuff.

*** Multilingual Logins

Multilingual logins will now work properly. The internal webpage
requests are set to English so the module only has to check for errors
in one language.
   
** Delete Action Added

Adds the delete package action in case any Trusted User wants to
use this module to delete packages. It is kind of scary what you
can do with it but heck... I trust you!
